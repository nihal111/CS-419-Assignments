Techniques used-
1. Basis functions and transformations- raised features to degree up to 10
2. Multiplication of features- multiplying features two at a time to produce new features
3. Feature selection- Remove unimporatant features.
4. Using adaptive learning rate- increase LR by 20% every 100 iterations, if price overshoots, reduce LR by 20%
